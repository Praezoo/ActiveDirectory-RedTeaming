# ActiveDirectory-RedTeaming

## Project Description

This repository documents an Active Directory Attack Simulation & Mapping Lab designed to emulate a real-world enterprise domain environment for hands-on cybersecurity learning.

- **Lab Deployment:** Multi-VM infrastructure replicating Windows Server-based Active Directory, domain controllers, organizational units, and security groups.
- **Enumeration & Path Mapping:** Collected user/group data and mapped attack paths using BloodHound and SharpHound.
- **Red Team Techniques:** Executed Kerberoasting, AS-REP Roasting, ACL analysis, and privilege escalation path identification to uncover and understand AD misconfigurations and vulnerabilities.
- **AD CS Exploration:** Ongoing evaluation of Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) exploitation and mitigation strategies.
- **Comprehensive Documentation:** Technical notes, attack chains, and remediation recommendations are included for educational and defensive purposes.

This lab serves as a practical platform for developing enterprise security skills, advancing red teaming capabilities, and demonstrating proficiency with professional security toolsets and methodologies.
